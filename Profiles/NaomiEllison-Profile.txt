Hello, I'm Naomi, I am a student at Washtenaw Community College for the Java Program. 
I've taken java/adv/framework, PHP, SQL, Linux, Android. I'm open to learning other languages as well.

I love to travel, workout, and spend time with my daughter. I look forward to working on this project with my category!
