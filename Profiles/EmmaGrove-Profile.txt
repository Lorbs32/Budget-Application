Hello I'm Emma and I am excited to learn a lot of new skills while creating this budget application. I am the only one who does not have Java experience, but I am excited to be team lead and learn with the group. 

I think  organization and planning will be where I contribute the most, and cant wait to see how the project turns out :)
