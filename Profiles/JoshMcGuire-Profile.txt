Hi I'm Josh a student at WCC in the computer science java program. I'm currently a product manager in the healthcare and clinical research industry. I love to build easy to use experiences with innovative thinking and technology.

I've taken the Intro Java, Adv Java, Spring Framework, Linux, and Database classes. In the PHP and Android classes this semester. Excited to dive in!
